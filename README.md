# mern-mob-boiler

__Uses [remmy](https://www.npmjs.com/package/remmy) for easy component scaffolding.__  
`npm i -g remmy`

This is the boilerplate that I use for all of my MERN scaffolds. It includes
Axios for handling client side AJAX requests, MobX for managing component
states, Mongojs for MongoDB CRUD functionality, and Webpack set up to bundle
up ES6 flavored JSX and React, Stylus, and SVGs as components.
